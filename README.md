# Rendy Sphere Visualizer

Rendy Sphere Visualizer is a render optimized for rendering 
spheres it uses different like distance field ambient occlusion
and raytraced shadows to archive high fidelity graphics in
real time. I manly use it as an visualizer for music. As the 
name implies I have used the Rendy rendering
framework. Rendy uses gfx-hal which is an hardware abstraction
layer which abstract many graphics apis like Vulkan, D3D, Metal
or OpenGL. Therefore, this project can run on a variety of 
platforms.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Pleas go to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the 
instructions. It will be quick and painless (hopefully).

This repository uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/). 
Please go ahead and download and install git-lfs. Please
make sure after you have cloned the repository, that you
pulled the lfs-file with following command.

```
git lfs pull
```

### Installing

If you have installed rustup and successfully cloned the 
repository, you can go ahead open a terminal in the project
folder and run: 

```
// Linux
cargo run --features vulkan --release

// Windows
cargo run --features dx12 --release

// Mac Os
cargo run --features metal --release
```

If you have a problem running the appropriate Command on the
operating system of your choice fear not opening an issue. 
I do not have all the operating systems at my disposal to test
all the backends.
